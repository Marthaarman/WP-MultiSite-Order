# Multisite Order

This plugin provides a tool to order the multisite subsites for admins.
The plugin hooks a filter on "the_sites", part of wordpress "get_sites()" functions. 
A network admin can change the order of the network's sites in an admin panel, which is directly translated into the filter.
Order is a manually set order, as in, a priority list.
